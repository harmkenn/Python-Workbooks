    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Before we dive into the material for this week’s article, let’s talk about the kind of problem that we are going to solve and its place in the exciting field of machine learning. T. Mitchell’s book “Machine Learning” (1997) gives a classic, general definition of machine learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the various problem settings T, P, and E can refer to completely different things. Some of the most popular tasks T in machine learning are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;\n",
    "\n",
    "regression – prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;\n",
    "\n",
    "clustering – identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;\n",
    "\n",
    "anomaly detection – search for instances that are “greatly dissimilar” to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances;\n",
    "\n",
    "and so many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good overview is provided in the “Machine Learning basics” chapter of “Deep Learning” (by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience E refers to data (we can’t go anywhere without it). Machine learning algorithms can be divided into those that are trained in supervised or unsupervised manner. In unsupervised learning tasks, one has a set consisting of instances described by a set of features. In supervised learning problems, there’s also a target variable, which is what we would like to be able to predict, known for each instance in a training set."

    "Example\n",
    "Classification and regression are supervised learning problems. For example, as a credit institution, we may want to predict loan defaults based on the data accumulated about our clients. Here, the experience E is the available training data: a set of instances (clients), a collection of features (such as age, salary, type of loan, past loan defaults, etc.) for each, and a target variable (whether they defaulted on the loan). This target variable is just a fact of loan default (1 or 0), so recall that this is a (binary) classification problem. If you were instead predicting by how much time the loan payment is overdue, this would become a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third term used in the definition of machine learning is a metric of the algorithm’s performance evaluation P. Such metrics differ for various problems and algorithms, and we’ll discuss them as we study new algorithms. For now, we’ll refer to a simple metric for classification algorithms, the proportion of correct answers – accuracy – on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at two supervised learning problems: classification and regression."

    "2. Decision Tree\n",
    "We begin our overview of classification and regression methods with one of the most popular ones – a decision tree. Decision trees are used in everyday life decisions, not just in machine learning. Flow diagrams are actually visual representations of decision trees. For example, Higher School of Economics publishes information diagrams to make the lives of its employees easier. Here is a snippet of instructions for publishing a paper on the Institution portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "../../_images/topic3_hse_instruction.png\n",
    "In terms of machine learning, one can see it as a simple classifier that determines the appropriate form of publication (book, article, chapter of the book, preprint, publication in the “Higher School of Economics and the Media”) based on the content (book, pamphlet, paper), type of journal, original publication type (scientific journal, proceedings), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is often a generalization of the experts’ experience, a means of sharing knowledge of a particular process. For example, before the introduction of scalable machine learning algorithms, the credit scoring task in the banking sector was solved by experts. The decision to grant a loan was made on the basis of some intuitively (or empirically) derived rules that could be represented as a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "../../_images/credit_scoring_toy_tree_english.png\n",
    "In our next case, we solve a binary classification problem (approve/deny a loan) based on the “Age”, “Home-ownership”, “Income”, and “Education” features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree as a machine learning algorithm is essentially the same thing as the diagram shown above; we incorporate a stream of logical rules of the form “feature \n",
    " value is less than \n",
    " and feature \n",
    " value is less than \n",
    " … => Category 1” into a tree-like data structure. The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. For example, using the above scheme, the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan: e.g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ll see later, many other models, although more accurate, do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a “black box” approach, where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Due to this “understandability” and similarity to human decision-making (you can easily explain your model to your boss), decision trees have gained immense popularity. C4.5, a representative of this group of classification methods, is even the first in the list of 10 best data mining algorithms (“Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining”, Knowledge and Information Systems, 2008. ResearchGate)."
