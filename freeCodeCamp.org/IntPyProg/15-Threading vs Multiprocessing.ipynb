    "Threading vs Multiprocessing\n",
    "We have two common approaches to run code in parallel (achieve multitasking and speed up your program) : via threads or via multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process\n",
    "A Process is an instance of a program, e.g. a Python interpreter. They are independent from each other and do not share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new process is started independently from the first process\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate memory space\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is not shared between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "One GIL (Global interpreter lock) for each process, i.e. avoids GIL limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Great for CPU-bound processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Child processes are interruptable/killable\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a process is slower that starting a thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger memory footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads\n",
    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution (Also known as \"leightweight process\"). A Process can spawn multiple threads. The main difference is that all threads within a process share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple threads can be spawned within one process\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is shared between all threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a thread is faster than starting a process\n",
    "\n",
    "Great for I/O-bound tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Leightweight - low memory footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "One GIL for all threads, i.e. threads are limited by GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading has no effect for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "Not interruptible/killable -> be careful with memory leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "increased potential for race conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading in Python\n",
    "Use the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The following example usually won't benefit from multiple threads since it is CPU-bound. It should just show the example of how to use threads."
